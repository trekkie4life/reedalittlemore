				<p><em>The problem:</em> Facebook's latest update brings up ads galore and clutters the screen</p>
				<p>I built this for myself because I was tired of having such a busy page when I went to Facebook. My eye was being distracted and I wanted to only have the information I want to see on the screen.</p>
				<p>Because Facebook disables jQuery on it's screen and also BFCache'ing it was difficult to find a way to always maintain the new 'ad-free' state invoked by the extension. The workaround this was to have Chrome's API help solve some of it by not only making sure the ads were removed on initial load but also if you switch to another tab and then switch back to the original [Facebook] tab.</p>
