				<p><em>The problem:</em> the process for diabetics of keeping track of their blood sugar requires remembering to transfer readings from their reader to a spreadsheet. They have to remember to print that spreadsheet and fax it to their doctor every single week.</p>
				<p>GlucoseAmigo sets out to simplify that process.  Designed with a mobile-first mindset, it's a way for individuals or caretakers to keep track of a diabetic's blood sugar level and weight, and share that data easily and automatically via email &amp; PDF with their doctor.</p>
				<p>In order to cover the case where there are multiple diabetics in a household (parent, spouse, kids), or in the case of a caretaker, a user can have multiple diabetics under their account. Each diabetic can have a unique doctor so the PDF of a diabetic's readings are sent to the appropriate physician.</p>
				<p>One can leave comments for a particular reading to show why it was low or high ("taken after eating") and if they hover over a point on the graph, the comment will pop explaining why the reading was out of the normal range.</p>
